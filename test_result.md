# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

          Fixed sign-in/login issues:
          1. Updated UserLogin model to accept 'identifier' field (email or username)
          2. Added get_user_by_username() and get_user_by_identifier() functions in queries.py
          3. Updated login endpoint to use identifier instead of just email
          4. Modified login response to include 'success' field and proper token
          5. Updated frontend AuthContext to use JWT token with localStorage
          6. Added axios interceptor to include Authorization header in all requests
          7. Fixed checkAuth to properly validate token
          8. Installed missing httplib2 and uritemplate dependencies

          AUTHENTICATION TESTING COMPLETE - All 8 tests PASSED!
          
          ✅ VERIFIED FUNCTIONALITY:
          1. User Registration: Creates user with valid JWT token containing user_id
          2. Login with Email: Accepts email in 'identifier' field, returns success=true, user object, token, and message
          3. Login with Username: Accepts username in 'identifier' field, returns proper response format
          4. Invalid Credentials: Correctly returns 401 with proper error messages for wrong password
          5. Nonexistent User: Correctly returns 401 with proper error messages for invalid email/username
          6. Protected Endpoint (/api/auth/me): Works with valid JWT token, returns user data without password_hash
          7. Protected Endpoint Security: Correctly returns 401 when no token provided
          8. Token Validation: Correctly returns 401 for invalid/malformed JWT tokens
          
          🔧 TECHNICAL VERIFICATION:
          - JWT tokens are properly formatted and contain required user_id field
          - Response format matches specification: {success: true, user, token, message}
          - Authorization header format: "Bearer <token>" works correctly
          - Security: No password_hash exposed in API responses
          - Error handling: Proper 401 responses with descriptive messages
